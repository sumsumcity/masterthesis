## 4.2. Runtime model poisoning (manipulating the model itself or its input/output logic)
> Category: runtime application security threat  

Impact: see Broad model poisoning.

This threat involves manipulating the behavior of the model by altering the parameters within the live system itself. These parameters represent the regularities extracted during the training process for the model to use in its task, such as neural network weights. Alternatively, compromising the model's input or output logic can also change its behavior or deny its service.
