### 3.1.2. Development-environment model poisoning
> Category: development-time threat  

This threat refers to manipulating behaviour of the model by not poisoning the training data, but instead manipalte elements in the development-environment that lead to the model or represent the model (i.e. model parameters), e.g. by manipulating storage of model parameters. When the model is trained by a supplier in a manipulative way and supplied as-is, then it is supply-chain model poisoning.
Training data manipulation is referred to as data poisoning.
