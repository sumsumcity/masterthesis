### 2.3.2. Model inversion and Membership inference
>Category: threat through use  

Model inversion (or _data reconstruction_) occurs when an attacker reconstructs a part of the training set by intensive experimentation during which the input is optimized to maximize indications of confidence level in the output of the model.
  
Membership inference is presenting a model with input data that identifies something or somebody (e.g. a personal identity or a portrait picture), and using any indication of confidence in the output to infer the presence of that something or somebody in the training set.
