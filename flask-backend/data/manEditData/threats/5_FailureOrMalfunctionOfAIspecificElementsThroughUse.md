## 2.5. Failure or malfunction of AI-specific elements through use
>Category: threat through use  

Description: specific input to the model leads to availabity issues (system being very slow or unresponsive, also called _denial of service_), typically caused by excessive resource usage. The failure occurs from frequency, volume, or the content of the input.

Impact: The AI systems is unavailable, leading to issues with processes, organizations or individuals that depend on the AI system (e.g. business continuity issues, safety issues in process control, unavailability of services)

For example: A _sponge attack_ or _energy latency attack_ provides input that is designed to increase the computation time of the model, potentially causing a denial of service.
