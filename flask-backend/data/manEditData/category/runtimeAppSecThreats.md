Impact: Conventional application security threats can impact confidentiality, integrity and availability of all assets.

AI systems are IT systems and therefore can have security weaknesses and vulnerabilities that are not AI-specific such as SQL-Injection. Such topics are covered in depth by many sources and are out of scope for this publication.  
Note: some controls in this document are application security controls that are not AI-specific, but applied to AI-specific threats (e.g. monitoring to detect model attacks).
